# Leverage
Buy leveraged token index funds via Dharma &amp; Set

The Leverage Interface is the next step towards allowing permissionless exposure to levered positions within a decentralized financial ecosystem. Our first implementation is the creation of a type of ‘leveraged index fund’ (similar to a 3X ETF). By combining the peer-to-peer lending protocol of Dharma and the Set standard for tokenizing baskets, we give people the ability to buy indexes on margin. In the future we can expand the scope of the Interface- allowing people to increase the weight behind their Augur predictions and leverage buys on any token through 0x Relayers.
